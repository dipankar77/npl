      <h3><strong>What About Cookies and Other Identifiers? </strong></h3>
      <p>To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve Nano Protection Layers Services, we use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our Cookies Notice.</p>
      <h3><strong>Does Nano Protection Layers Share Your Personal Information? </strong></h3>
      <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. Nano Protection Layers shares customers' personal information only as described below and with Nano Protection Layers.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries that Nano Protection Layers.com, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <span>Transactions involving Third Parties:</span><span> We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third-parties for use on or through Nano Protection Layers Services. For example, you can order products from third-parties through our stores, and download applications from third-party application providers from our App Store. We may also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses. You can tell when a third-party is involved in your transactions, and we share customers' personal information related to those transactions with that third-party.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
      <span>Third-Party Service Providers</span><span>: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service.

      </li>
      <li>
      <span>Business Transfers</span><span>: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Nano Protection Layers.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</span>

      <li><span>We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.</span></li>

      <li><span>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of personal customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. </span></li>
      <li><span>Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs. Click here for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device.</span></li>

      <h3><strong>What About Advertising?</strong></h3>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites:</strong><span> Nano Protection Layers Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at Nano Protection Layers, including interest-based ads, please read our Interest-Based Ads policy. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the Advertising Preferences page.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:</strong><span> We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Nano Protection Layers ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the Advertising Preferences page.</span>
      </li>
